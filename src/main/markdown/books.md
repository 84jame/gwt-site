This book is a tutorial on how to build the book's sample application with NetBeans, Ext-GWT, MySQL with JPA, GWT-RPC, and iReport. Beyond the initial chapter on setup, the book is mostly code and does not discuss architecture such as MVP or Command pattern, so it is suitable mainly for novices looking for a cookie-cutter approach using the same stack.

## Constants<a id="Constants"></a>

This example will walk through the process of creating a class of internationalized constant strings &quot;hello, world&quot; and &quot;goodbye, world&quot; in your GWT application. The example
will create a Java interface named <tt>MyConstants</tt> that abstracts those strings. You can reference the <tt>MyConstants</tt> methods in your GWT code when you want to display
one of those strings to the user and they will be translated appropriately for all locales that have matching <tt>.properties</tt> files.

Begin by creating a default properties file called <tt>MyConstants.properties</tt> in your GWT project. You can place the file anywhere in your module's source path, but the
<tt>.properties</tt> file and corresponding interface must be in the same package. It's fine to place the file in the same package as your module's entry point class.

<pre>
helloWorld = hello, world
goodbyeWorld = goodbye, world
</pre>

You can also create a localized translation for each supported locale in separate properties files. The properties file must be named the same as our interface name, in our
case <tt>MyConstants</tt>, with the appropriate suffix that indicates the [locale setting](DevGuideI18nLocale.html#LocaleSpecifying). In this case, we localize
for Spanish using the filename <tt>MyConstants_es.properties</tt>:

<pre>
helloWorld = hola, mundo
goodbyeWorld = adi√≥s, mundo
</pre>

Now define an interface that abstracts those strings by extending the built-in <tt>Constants</tt> interface. Create a new Java interface in the same package where the
<tt>.properties</tt> files were created. The method names must match the tag names uses in the <tt>.properties</tt> files:

<pre class="prettyprint">
public interface MyConstants extends Constants {
  String helloWorld();
  String goodbyeWorld();
}
</pre>

**Tip:** The i18nCreator tool automates the generation of Constants interface subinterfaces like the one above. The tool generates Java code so that you only need to
maintain the <tt>.properties</tt> files. It also works for <tt>ConstantsWithLookup</tt> and <tt>Messages</tt> classes.

Note that <tt>MyConstants</tt> is declared as an interface, so you cannot instantiate it directly with <tt>new</tt>. To use the internationalized constants, you create a Java
instance of <tt>MyConstants</tt> using the [GWT.create(Class)](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/core/client/GWT.html#create(java.lang.Class)) facility:

<pre class="prettyprint">
public void useMyConstants() {
  MyConstants myConstants = GWT.create(MyConstants.class);
  Window.alert(myConstants.helloWorld());
}
</pre>

You don't need to worry about the Java implementation of your static string classes. Static string initialization uses a [deferred binding generator](DevGuideCodingBasics.html#DevGuideDeferredBinding) which allows the GWT
compiler to take care of automatically generating the Java code necessary to implement your <tt>Constants</tt> subinterface depending on the [locale](DevGuideI18nLocale.html).

## ConstantsWithLookup<a id="ConstantsWithLookup"></a>

The [ConstantsWithLookup](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/ConstantsWithLookup.html) interface is
identical to <tt>Constants</tt> except that the interface also includes a method to look up strings by property name, which facilitates dynamic binding to constants by name at
runtime. <tt>ConstantsWithLookup</tt> can sometimes be useful in highly data-driven applications. One caveat: <tt>ConstantsWithLookup</tt> is less efficient than
<tt>Constants</tt> because the compiler cannot discard unused constant methods,
resulting in larger applications.

## Using Annotations<a id="ConstantsAnnotations"></a>

The annotations discussed here are the ones specific to <tt>Constants</tt>
and <tt>ConstantsWithLookup</tt> &mdash; for shared annotations see the [main Internationalization
page](DevGuideI18n.html#DevGuideAnnotations).

### Method Annotations

The following annotations apply to methods in a <tt>Constants</tt> subtype
and must correspond to the return type of the method.  They provide a type-safe
way to reference constants, and can include Java compile-time constant
references.

*   **<tt>[@DefaultBooleanValue(boolean val)](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Constants.DefaultBooleanValue.html)</tt>** Sets the default value for a method which returns a <tt>boolean</tt>.
*   **<tt>[@DefaultDoubleValue(double val)](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Constants.DefaultDoubleValue.html)</tt>** Sets the default value for a method which returns a <tt>double</tt>.
*   **<tt>[@DefaultFloatValue(float val)](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Constants.DefaultFloatValue.html)</tt>** Sets the default value for a method which returns a <tt>float</tt>.
*   **<tt>[@DefaultIntValue(int val)](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Constants.DefaultIntValue.html)</tt>** Sets the default value for a method which returns a <tt>int</tt>.
*   **<tt>[@DefaultStringArrayValue({String str, ...})](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Constants.DefaultStringArrayValue.html)</tt>** Sets the default value for a method which returns a <tt>String</tt> array.
*   **<tt>[@DefaultStringMapValue({String key, String value, ...})](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Constants.DefaultStringMapValue.html)</tt>**
    Sets the default value for a method which returns a
<tt>Map&lt;String,String&gt;</tt> or a raw map (which will still be a
<tt>String=&gt;String</tt> map).  The number of supplied values must be even,
and the first entry of each pair is the key and the second is the value.
*   **<tt>[@DefaultStringValue(String str)](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Constants.DefaultStringValue.html)</tt>** Sets the default value for a method which returns a <tt>String</tt>.

## Using Property Files<a id="ConstantsProperties"></a>

The properties file format for <tt>Constants</tt> and
<tt>ConstantsWithLookup</tt> is simply <tt>key=value</tt>, but there are a few
points to remember:

*   <tt>#</tt> must be escaped as it is a comment character
*   When the type of the method is <tt>String[]</tt>, an ASCII comma is used
  to separate values, which means that any commas included in a value must be
  escaped with a backslash.  Also, beware of translators using a different
  character to separate translated values.
*   In the case of a <tt>Map</tt>-valued method, the entry in the properties
  file for that method will be a comma-separated set of keys, and then those
  keys have their own entries with their associated value.  Example:
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  Map&lt;String,String&gt; colorMap();

  colors=header, body, footer
  header=red
  body=white
  footer=blue
  </pre><p/>
produces a map <tt>{ header=&gt;red, body=&gt;white, footer=&gt;blue
}</tt>
